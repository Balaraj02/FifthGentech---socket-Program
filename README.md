# TCP/IP Communication Server and Client

This project demonstrates a TCP/IP server and client implementation in Python.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

## Steps for Running the Files

### Running Server 

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `server.py` is located.

2. Run the server using the command:
    ```sh
    python server.py
    ```

### Running Client 

1. Open another terminal and navigate to the directory where `client.py` is located.

2. Run the client using the command:
    ```sh
    python client.py
    ```

### Notes

- Ensure no other services are running on port `9999` to avoid conflicts.
- Modify the IP address and port number in both `server.py` and `client.py` if needed.
